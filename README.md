### Installation Instructions for Window Computers:
1. Download [Box Drive](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads) for Windows
- Instructions on how to install it [here](https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043697474-Installing-and-Updating-Box-Drive)
- Box does not support having both Box Sync and Box Drive installed on your computer, so uninstall box sync if you have that first
2. Sign in to Box Drive with your UTD email (if box asks for a email), then your UTD Box login information (i.e. netid and password)
- Installation is successful if you see Box as an option in the side menu of your File Explorer desktop application

### Usage Instructions
- the browse files button is used to select which file (i.e. transcript) the tool is going to get information from and use
- when selecting a file, if you can't find the file you need, try changing the file type to "All Files" in the bottom right drop down menu of the file explorer
